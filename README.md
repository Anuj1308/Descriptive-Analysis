# Descriptive-Analysis
This project explores various data analysis techniques. The analysis begins with univariate statistics on variables. Bivariate analysis then examines relationships such as study hours vs. GPA, with correlation analysis quantifying these links. PCA is used to reduce data complexity.

## Project Objective:
To identify key factors that impact the academic performance and career success of college students, analyzing how variables like study hours, socioeconomic background, mental health, extracurricular involvement, and access to mentorship collectively influence student success.

## Data Collection:
Use a comprehensive dataset of college students that includes:

### Demographic data: 
Age, gender, socioeconomic status, geographical location.
Academic metrics: GPA, study hours, attendance, subject scores.
Career outcomes: Job placement status, starting salary, internship experiences, industry.
Lifestyle and extracurriculars: Mental health scores, hours spent on extracurriculars, participation in mentorship programs.

### Analysis Plan and Application of Techniques:
#### 1. Univariate Statistics
Application: Start by analyzing the distribution of key variables individually. For example, calculate the average GPA, average hours spent studying, average starting salary, etc.
Insight: This gives a baseline understanding of the dataset, highlighting central tendencies and variances in each variable.
#### 2. Bivariate Associations
Application: Examine pairs of variables, such as:
Study hours and GPA
Socioeconomic status and starting salary
Extracurricular involvement and mental health scores
Insight: This can reveal preliminary insights, like whether students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have higher starting salaries or if more study hours correlate with better GPA.
#### 3. Correlation Analysis
Application: Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson’s) for continuous variables, such as:
Study hours and GPA
Mental health score and GPA
Insight: Quantify the strength of relationships, such as whether there’s a significant positive correlation between hours studied and GPA, or if mental health scores negatively correlate with academic performance.
#### 4. Covariance
Application: Calculate covariance between related variables, like:
GPA and starting salary
Mental health score and extracurricular hours
Insight: Covariance can suggest if variables move together in a positive or negative direction, helping to reveal underlying trends in the data.
#### 5. Multivariate Analysis
Application: Use techniques like PCA or factor analysis to explore the relationships between multiple variables (e.g., study hours, mental health, extracurricular activities) and see if they can be grouped into latent factors influencing academic and career outcomes.
Insight: For instance, factors related to “Academic Engagement” and “Personal Wellbeing” may emerge, providing a higher-level view of influences on student success.
#### 6. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Application: If you want to analyze categorical groups (e.g., the impact of different types of mentorship programs on GPA), you can use ANOVA to compare means between groups:
GPA across different types of mentorship
Starting salary across various college majors
Insight: This will help identify if specific factors (e.g., type of mentorship) significantly affect performance outcomes among students.
